    "The [Nikon Laser Radar](https://www.nikonmetrology.com/en-us/product/laser-radar-mv331-351) is a high accuracy, large volume, non-contact, 3D measurement device that is gaining considerable adoption in the automotive industry for [in-line car body inspection](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odIYMRyCFDo). This inspection has traditionally been done with a tactile CMM which is a slow process requiring one-of-every-N cars to be spurred off the main assembly line into a carefully controlled 'measurement room'. Automotive manufacturers [can achieve considerable cost and time savings](http://www.nikonmetrology.com/en-gb/product/laser-radar-shop-floor-cmm) by switching to a robot-mounted laser-based measurement system such as the Laser Radar to inspect *all* part instances in-line, without special 1-of-N measurement followed by generalizing results to the remainder of the unmeasured instances. The laser-based measurement technology is mature, however, this relatively new adoption by the short cycle-time automotive industry has placed new pressure on maximizing the quantity and quality of feature measurements that can be made in short, fixed time windows common in assembly line manufacturing. By applying optimization techniques to the measurement plan and process, we can to increase both the quality and quantity of measurements that can be made in a fixed time window.\n",
    "\n",
    "Automotive engineers routinely specify geometric features that must be inspected on a car when it is in the [Body-In-White](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Body_in_white) phase of manufacturing. Inspection involves measuring the 3D locations and dimensions of 200-300 holes, slots, studs, surfaces, etc relative to fixed locations on the car. The measured location of these features are compared to the nominal locations specified in the CAD drawings. [Statistical process control](https://www.itl.nist.gov/div898/handbook/pmc/section1/pmc12.htm) calculations are performed to evaluate the overal accuracy, precision, reliability, and repeatability of the manufacturing process. The task of scanning each feature and extracting the location of the measured geometry relative to a global ‘car coordinate system’ is well handled by existing software.\n",
    "![Nikon Laser Radar](LR_Combo.jpg)\n",
    "\n",
    "However, the process of deciding *how* to measure these features using the Laser Radar is a decision largely made by manufacturing engineers using 'rule-of-thumb' techniques based on their experience with robot and tactile CMM programming. Often these engineers have little experience with laser based measurement systems. The opportunity to optimize this scenario lies in several sub-problems, which we model, solve, and discuss:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. *Determine the optimal order in which to measure a list of features.* Pointing the measuring laser of the device to each feature location requires moving a mirror in azimuth and elevation, both of which have known velocity and acceleration profiles and limits. The optimization task is: For a given fixed laser radar location relative to the car, find an ordering of a given list of features to be measured that minimizes total measurement time.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. *The optimal order depends on the location of the Laser Radar* The laser radar measures by directing its mirror in two axis, forming a spherical coordinate system. The time it takes to move the laser from one target location to another is not dependent on the cartesian distance between the two targets, but rather a function of the angular separation of the features from the perspective of the Laser Radar. This function will be investigated.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. *Determine the optimal order if **two** Laser Radars are available to measure* If the measurement cell had two Laser Radars located at fixed positions, and list of $n$ features to measure. If they could work simultaneously, each measuring seprate features, what is the shortest amount of time in which the job could be completed? Which features should each Laser Radar measure? How can we divide the features between two Laser Radars, and simulaneously order those features for each Laser Radar such that the *maximum* measurement time of each of the two Laser Radars is *minimized*.\n",
    " \n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "### 2.1 Coordinate Systems\n",
    "Within the work cell, there are many coordinate systems being used. To keep the focus of this work on the optimization component, we will simplify the work cell to two fundamental coordinate systems: The Part Coordinate System (PCS), and Machine Coordinate System (MCS). It is important to understand each and be able to freely convert points in space between these coordinate systems.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Part coordinate system (PCS)**: This is a 3D Cartesian coordinate system that is the same coordinate system the engineer used in CAD to design the car. In our models, this coordinate system has its origin on the centerline of the car, both side-to-side and front-to-back, and is located underneath the car. The Z-axis is points toward the front of the car, and the Y-axis points upward. Being a right-handed coordinate system, this leaves the X-axis to points toward the driver's side door.  All features to be measured are defined in this coordinate system. Also, the location and orientation of the Laser Radar in the work cell is specified in this coordinate system.\n",
    "![Part Coordinate System](PCS.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Machine coordinate system (MCS)**: This is the coordinate system from the viewpoint of the Laser Radar. (The historical name 'Machine' comes from the world of CNC and tactile CMM devices). The Laser Radar measures in a [spherical coordinate system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spherical_coordinate_system): It measures *range* using reflected signal from an IR laser, and the laser itself can be 'steered' in *azimuth* and *elevation* by means of a motorized mirror that spins on one axis and pivots on an orthoganal axis. The *azimuth*, or $\\phi$, ranges from -180 to 180 degrees $(-\\pi, \\pi)$, with 0 being the front of the Laser Radar. The *elevation*, or $\\theta$, ranges from -45 to +45 degrees relative to horizontal. To stay with standard ISO spherical coordinate conventions, we will define this as $\\theta$, to be measured as the inclination angle, or the angle relative to vertical, giving it a valid range of $(\\frac{\\pi}{4}, \\frac{3\\pi}{4})$, with $\\frac{\\pi}{2}$ being horizontal. See diagram below (courtesy Wikipedia). The $\\phi$ and $\\theta$ angles of the mirror are recorded by two highly accurate encoders inside the Laser Radar, and when synchronized with the laser's range measurement, form a spherical coordinate triple $(r, \\theta, \\phi)$ that originates from the center of the mirror on the laser radar.\n",
    "![Spherical Coordinate System](SphericalCS.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "The first transformation required for optimzation is converting Spherical MCS to Cartesian MCS. This is accomplished using standard trigonometry:\n",
    "\\begin{align*}\n",
    "x &= r \\sin \\theta \\cos \\phi \\\\\n",
    "y &= r \\sin \\theta \\sin \\phi \\\\\n",
    "z &= r \\cos \\theta\n",
    "\\end{align*}\n",
    "And likewise, we can convert Cartesian MCS to Spherical MCS:\n",
    "\\begin{align*}\n",
    "r &= \\sqrt{x^2 + y^2 + z^2} \\\\\n",
    "\\theta &= \\arccos\\frac{z}{\\sqrt{x^2 + y^2 + z^2}} = \\arctan \\frac{\\sqrt{x^2+y^2}}{z}\\\\\n",
    "\\phi &= \\arctan \\frac{y}{x} \\\\\n",
    "\\end{align*}\n",
    "\n",
    "Note the manipulation of $\\theta$ by trig identities to reformulate using the $\\arctan$ function. For correct results in quadrants 2 and 4, it is necessary to use the function `atan2()` programmatically to account for sign changes.\n",
    "\n",
    "The second transformation required for optimization is converting Cartesian MCS to PCS. This is accomplished via a standard 3D affine transformation. We define the location and orientation of the Laser Radar within the part coordinate system according to a homogeneous transformation matrix. If the Laser Radar's orientation is described by its 3 orthogonal axis $X$, $Y$, and $Z$ as orthonormal vectors $U$, $V$, and $W$ in PCS, and the Laser Radar's mirror center is described in PCS as point $(LR_x, LR_y, LR_z)$, then the matrix that transforms a point in Cartesian MCS point to the same point in PCS is \n",
    "\\begin{equation*}\n",
    "T_{\\text{MCS to PCS}} = \\begin{bmatrix} \n",
    "U_x & V_x & W_x & LR_x \\\\\n",
    "U_y & V_y & W_y & LR_y \\\\\n",
    "U_z & V_z & W_z & LR_z \\\\\n",
    "0   & 0   & 0   & 1\n",
    "\\end{bmatrix}\n",
    "\\end{equation*}\n",
    "And, of course, the matrix that transforms PCS points to Cartesian MCS points is simply the inverse:\n",
    "\\begin{equation*}\n",
    "T_{\\text{PCS to MCS}} = T_{\\text{MCS to PCS}}^{-1} \n",
    "\\end{equation*}\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2.2 Measurement Feature Definitions\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 2.2.1 Feature CSV Files\n",
    "\n",
    "In this problem, we are given a list of features on the Car Body that must be scanned by the Nikon Laser Radar. Since these features are extracted directed from the CAD figures of the Car Body, they are given to us in the Cartesian PCS coordinate system. For a given features $X_i$, we are given\n",
    "\n",
    "* The Feature Type - This is what the laser is measuring. This can be Hole, Slot, Stud, Rectangle, Surface Vector, or Sphere.\n",
    "* $(X, Y, Z)$ - The cartesian coordinates of the feature in the PCS coordinate system.\n",
    "* $(I, J, K)$ - The normal vector of the feature in PCS.\n",
    "\n",
    "An example of one of the feature csv files that we use in this problem is *50_Holes_FrontLeft.csv*. These features in this file can be visualized on the car shown here:\n",
    "![50_Holes_FrontLeft](50_Holes_FrontLeft.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 2.2.2 Lasar Radar Location CSV Files\n",
    "\n",
    "We are also given different potential locations and orientations for the Lasar Radar, from which it will scan the car. These are in the files *Location1.csv*, *LocationLeft.csv*, and *LocationRight.csv*. Each one of these files contains a 4x4 matrix in the format of a $T_{\\text{MCS to PCS}}$ matrix seen above that encode the location and orientation of the Lasar Radar. As shown below, we can use this to transform the $(X, Y, Z)$ feature coordinates in the PCS coordinate system to cartesian coordinates in the MCS coordinate system.\n",
    "\n",
    "Notably, when solving the shortest path problem for different locations of the Lasar Radar, we get different solutions (See Section **4.2 Location, Location, Location (of the LR)**).\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2.3 Laser Radar Motion\n",
    "\n",
    "For the purposes of this project, we assume that the Nikon Laser Radar remains stationary and can rotate its laser in azimuth and elevation to create a scanning path through all of the required features of the car body. We relax the problem here by ignoring acceleration of the motorized mirror, as we believe this to be negligible. However, the Lasar Radar is capable of rotating in azimuth and elevation simultaneously, which we must incorporate into our model. To do so, we first map each feature $X_i$ into Spherical Coordinates relative to the MCS as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "$X_{\\text{i, MCS Cartesian}} = T_{\\text{PCS to MCS}} * X_{\\text{i, PCS Cartesian}}$\n",
    "\n",
    "From here, we can find the Spherical Coordinates $(r_{\\text{i, MCS}}, \\theta_{\\text{i, MCS}}, \\phi_{\\text{i, MCS}})$ using the trigonometric equations described above.\n",
    "\n",
    "From this, we can convert our list of features $\\{X_i\\}_{i=1}^{\\text{Number Features}}$ into spherical coordinates.\n",
    "\n",
    "For any two features, $X_i, X_j$, we can calculate the time for the Lasar Radar to travel between them as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Assume that the Lasar Radar starts at either point $X_i$ or $X_j$, and it immediately begins rotating in both azimuth *and* elevation to the other point.\n",
    "* We assume that the Lasar Radar rotates in azimuth with speed $v_{\\text{azimuth}}$ radians per second, and rotates in elevation with speed $v_{\\text{elevation}}$ radians per second.\n",
    "* The time that it will take to rotate in azimuth is\n",
    "\n",
    "\\begin{equation*}\n",
    "\\frac{|\\phi_i - \\phi_j|}{v_{\\text{elevation}}}\n",
    "\\end{equation*}\n",
    "\n",
    "* Similarly, the time that it takes to rotate in elevation is\n",
    "\n",
    "\\begin{equation*}\n",
    "\\frac{|\\theta_i - \\theta_j|}{v_{\\text{azimuth}}}\n",
    "\\end{equation*}\n",
    "\n",
    "* Since the Lasar Radar moves in both of these directions simultaneously, the time it takes to travel from feature $X_i$ to feature $X_j$ is the maximum of these two quantities, or the *Inifnity Norm* of the vector of travel times of each direction in spherical coordinates. Specifically, this is:\n",
    "\n",
    "\\begin{equation*}\n",
    "t_{i,j} = \\big\\Vert\\frac{\\theta_i - \\theta_j}{v_{\\text{elevation}}}, \\frac{\\phi_i - \\phi_j}{v_{\\text{azimuth}}}\\big\\Vert_{\\infty}\n",
    "\\end{equation*}\n",
    "\n",
    "For the scope of this project, we simply set $v_{\\text{elevation}} = v_{\\text{azimuth}} = 1\\frac{radian}{second}$. However, this formulation is flexible enough that it would allow an Automotive Engineer to substitute in the speeds for their own Laser Radars, and calculate the correct solution with respect to their setup.\n",

    "### 2.4 Optimal Measurement Plan Path\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2.4.1 Formulating as TSP problem\n",
    "\n",
    "**Inputs:** \n",
    "* _LR Location/orientation matrix_: The location and orientation of the laser radar with respect to the features to be measured is critical in determining the cost matrix because the nodes to visit are defined in spherical coordinates relative to the mirror of the laser radar.\n",
    "* _Mirror Azimuth and Elevation velocities_: These velocities determine how fast the laser radar can move its measurement laser from one location to another. For this model, we assume instantaneous acceleration to start and stop the mirror, and constant velocity during travel. This is reasonable for this model because the mirror assembly has relatively low mass and low moment of inertia, so accelerations are fast.\n",
    "* _Unordered site location list:_ (csv file containing points to visit) This defines the location of the features to be measured in spherical coordinates with respect to the Laser Radar's mirror. The feature definition file described above contains feature locations in cartesian coordinates relative to the car's coordinate system. Before constructing the cost matrix, these cartesian coordinates must be converted to spherical coordinates relative to the Laser Radar's coordinate system. This transformation is described above. This is essential since the time taken for the laser to move from one feature to another depends on the position of the LR. In other words, the costs between nodes in the TSP vary with the position of the LR.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Output:**\n",
    "* _Optimal Ordered Site Visiting List_: This is the optimal ordering of sites produced by the solved TSP; this makes up the optimal path for the Lasar Radar to follow to minimize the total time for a single scan.\n",
    "* _Minimal Scan Time_: This is the amount of time that it will take to scan all of the features, using the given optimal path.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Assumptions:**\n",
    "* We assume that we can start from anywhere. That is, the time it takes the Laser Radar to travel from its arbitrary resting location to the first point is not included in our calculation\n",
    "* We only wish to visit all points and then terminate after reaching the last point. We do not wish to return to the start.\n",
    "* We assume that the Laser Radar has been positioned to have line-of-sight visibility to all features to be measured. That is, the laser's path to each of the featuresis not occluded by other physical objects.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Cost Matrix:**\n",
    "* _Travel Time Matrix_: As seen above, we can compute the distance between two features $X_i$, $X_j$ by first converting their PCS coordinates into MCS coordinates; then, converting these into MCS spherical coordinates, and then finally taking the infinity norm over the azimuth travel time and elevation travel time for the two features. By iterating over all pairs of features $X_i$, $X_j$ in our dataset, we can construct a cost matrix $C^{NxN}$ such that $C_{i,j}$ is the travel time between features $X_i$ and $X_j$; this is simply $t_{i,j}$ as calculated above. By precomputing this cost matrix, we can solve the computational geometry portion of this problem entirely in the preprocessing step, leaving the remainder of this problem to be solved as a standard Travelling Salesman Problem (TSP).\n",
    "\n",
    "**Optimization Algorithm**:\n",
    "\n",
    "Once the inputs are properly defined, and a cost matrix is constructed, TSP algorithm can be applied. In our implementation, we implemented four different TSP algorithms:\n",
    "1. MTZ formulation (from class lecture)\n",
    "2. Iterative Subtour Elimination (from class lecture)\n",
    "3. Subtour Elmination using Lazy Constraints (based on 2, but using additional JuMP/Gurobi capability of `@lazyconstraint`)\n",
    "4. Symmetric Matrix & Lazy Subtour Elimination (based on Gurobi website [example](http://examples.gurobi.com/traveling-salesman-problem/))\n",
    "\n",
    "We evaluated the performance of each, and settled on \\#4 - the Symmetrix Matrix with Lazy Subtour Elimination algorithm. Therefore, only this algorithm will be discussed here, but a thorough comparison of all four can be seen in the [Appendix](#6.-Appendix). The high-level results of this evaluation are also discussed in [Section 4](#4.-Results-and-discussion).\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2.4.2 Optimization Algorithm - Decision Variables\n",
    "\n",
    "Given our set of $N$ site locations $\\{X_i\\}_{i=1}^{N}$ for the Lasar Radar to scan, we wish to construct the Optimal Scanning Path between them. We can first generate the Cost Matrix $C^{NxN}$ that encodes the travel time between each of the N features. Effectively, this is now reducible to the TSP Problem, as we wish to find the minimal travel time for a path connecting our N features. In a similar manner to other TSP formulations, we encode the selected path in a Symmetric Binary Matrix $Z^{NxN}$, such that\n",
    "\n",
    "* $Z_{i,j} = Z_{j,i} = 1$ if there is an edge between $X_i$, $X_j$ in the optimal search path.\n",
    "* $Z_{i,j} = Z_{j,i} = 0$ if there is no edge between $X_i$, $X_j$ in the optimal search path.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here, Z is the Decision Variable for the optimization problem.\n",
    "\n",
    "Something notable in our formulation is that $Z_{i,j} = Z_{j,i}, \\forall i,j \\in {1, ..., N}$. Effectively, this means that we are creating an undirected graph instead of a directed one. Then from this solution we can extract one of two optimal paths, which simply are the reverse of eachother.\n",
    "\n",
    "For this problem particularly, we decided that this was a reasonable assumption because our Cost Matrix C is symmetric itself, so both optimal solutions (forwards and backwards) will take the same time to scan. Therefore we can pick one of these two paths arbitrarily and still recover an optimal path to minimize scan time.\n",
    "\n",
    "One of the benefits of using an undirected graph formulation is that in the subtour elimination part of the solution, we only have to remove a given subtour once. In practice, we found that without this simplification we would often see that same subtours appearing twice, with the second one being a reverse ordering of this first. By using this formulation of the problem we effectively cut the number of iterations that we must do to find an optimal solution without subtours down by half.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2.4.3 Optimization Algorithm - Constraints\n",
    "\n",
    "The choice to use an undirected graph also changes how we represent our *Indregree* and *Outdegree* constraints. In previous formulations for the TSP Problem we explicit constraints on each node $X_i$ such that\n",
    "\n",
    "\\begin{equation*}\n",
    "Indegree(X_i) = 1, \\forall i \\in \\{1,...,N\\}\n",

    "\n",
    "\\begin{equation*}\n",
    "Outdegree(X_i) = 1, \\forall i \\in \\{1,...,N\\}\n",
    "\\end{equation*}\n",
    "\n",
    "Since we use an undirected graph, we simply need to state the the *Degree* of each node $X_i$ is 2 (we can afford to do this because creating an incoming edge forces an outoging edge by the symmetric formulation); we can encode with the following constraint:\n",
    "\n",
    "\\begin{equation*}\n",
    "\\sum_{j=1}^{N} Z_{i,j} = 2, \\forall i \\in \\{1,...,N\\}\n",

    "\n",
    "\\begin{equation*}\n",
    "Z_{i,i} = 0, \\forall i \\in \\{1,...,N\\}\n",
    "\\end{equation*}\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, any time that we solve this problem and encounted a *Subtour* in our solution, $\\{X_{S1}, X_{S2}, ..., X_{Sk}\\}$ such that {k < n}, we encode a constraint in our model to explicitly disallow *this particular subtour*:\n",

    "\\sum_{i = 1}^{k} \\sum_{j = 1}^{k} Z_{Si, Sj} \\leq k -1\n",
    "\\end{equation*}\n",
    "\n",
    "Notably, this constraint not only disallows *this particular subtour*, but also *all possible subtours that can be formed out of these k nodes*. This is different than the standard Subtour Elimination Constraint that was discussed in lecture, but we found that this formulation for the Subtour Elimination Constraint dramatically reduced the computational time needed to solve the problem. Further discussion on the differences in efficiency between different problem formulations can be found in [Section 4](#4.-Results-and-discussion) and in the [Appendix](#6.-Appendix).\n",

    "### 2.4.6 Optimizing 'Path' versus 'Tour'\n",
    "\n",
    "Because we are only interested in quickly measuring each feature (visiting each site), we have no interest in returning to the first site at the conclusion of the measurement. The next job for the Laser Radar is not likely to be the same sequence of measurements, so we do not care where the laser is pointing at the conclusion of the measurement. Therefore, we desire a 'path' rather than a 'tour'.\n",
    "\n",
    "To modify the TSP algorithm to produce a 'path' rather than a 'tour', we made the following changes:\n",
    "1. Add an additional 'dummy point' to the list of points to visit.\n",
    "2. Append a row and column to the cost matrix so that the cost to travel from any real point to the 'dummy point' is 0. \n",
    "3. This, node with zero cost to everywhere gives a 'free pass' for the laser to move from any one single feature to any one single other feature with zero cost (by traveling through the 'dummy point').

    "## 2.5 Optimizing Two Laser Radars\n",
    "\n",
    "In case of the 2 LR problem where we have two Laser Radars avaiable to simultaneously measure the feature set, we retain much of the previous formulation but add some critical pieces. If the two LRs were located at the same position one can consider the 2 LR problem as solving a TSP where we are allowed to have 2 subtours that span the entire set of nodes. But, our case is more complicated because the 2 LRs have different cost matrices associated with them because they are at different positions.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2.5.1 Formulation as a TSP Problem\n",
    "\n",
    "**Inputs:** \n",
    "* _LR Locations/orientation matrices_: The location and orientation of the two laser radars with respect to the features to be measured. Note that we now have two cost matrices as opposed to one in the previous case. This is the critical aspect of the problem that makes it interesting. The cost matrices are bound to be different for the two LRs since the \"distance\" between two features is _different_ for the two LRs. \n",
    "* _Mirror Azimuth and Elevation velocities_: We retain this from the previous formulation and assume both LRs are identical. (Changing this is trivial as it would only affect the cost matrix)\n",
    "* _Unordered site location list:_ (csv file containing points to visit). This remains the same as well.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Output:**\n",
    "* _Optimal Ordered Site Visiting List for each LR_: This is the optimal ordering of sites produced by the solved TSP; this makes up the optimal path for each Lasar Radar to follow to minimize the total time for a single scan. Note that each LR need not scan all features, just that the union of the features scanned by the two LRs must be the entire feature set.\n",
    "* _Minimal Scan Time_: This is the amount of time that it will take to scan all of the features, using the given optimal path. This will be the maximum of the time required for each single LR to complete it's \"subscan\" since both LRs scan features simultaneously. (We use the epigraph trick to formulate this)\n",
    "\n",
    "**Assumptions:**\n",
    "* We assume that we can start from anywhere. That is, the time it takes each Laser Radar to travel from its arbitrary resting location to the first point is not included in our calculation\n",
    "* We only wish to visit all points and then terminate after reaching the last point. We do not wish to return to the start. This holds true for both LRs.\n",
    "* We assume that both Laser Radars have been positioned to have line-of-sight visibility to all features to be measured.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Cost Matrices:**\n",
    "* _Travel Time Matrices_: We compute the Cost Matrix for both LRs in the same manner as we did above. The problem then resolves to solving two TSPs where the desired minimal cost is the maximum of the cost of the two problems and the requirement is that the union of the nodes covered by the two TSPs is equal to the total set of nodes. Note that optimality ensures that this requires that each feature be measured only once since having the other LR measuring adds unnecessary cost.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Optimization Algorithm**:\n",
    "\n",
    "The problem essentially boils down to two simultaneous TSP problems with an array of binary 'selector' variables to track which LR measures a given feature. We modify the objective to take into account the maximum cost of the two subtours. We discuss this in more detail below.\n",
    "Although we established that #4 is the most efficient, in this problem the presence of empty rows (other LR measures that feature), causes the formulation in this manner to be complicated. Hence we go back to non-symmetric formulation from #3.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2.5.2 Optimization Algorithm: Decision Variables:\n",
    "Given our set of $N$ site locations $\\{X_i\\}_{i=1}^{N}$ for the two Lasar Radars to scan. We generate two Cost Matrices $C_1^{NxN}$ and $C_2^{NxN}$ that encodes the travel time between each of the N features for the respective LRs. We create two Binary Matrices $Z_1^{NxN}$ and $Z_2^{NxN}$ that represent the paths taken by the two LRs such that:\n",
    "\n",
    "* $Z_{k_{i,j}} = Z_{k_{j,i}} = 1$ if there is an edge between $X_i$, $X_j$ in the optimal search path traced by LR $k$, $k \\in {1, 2}$.\n",
    "* $Z_{k_{i,j}} = Z_{k_{j,i}} = 0$ if there is no edge between $X_i$, $X_j$ in the optimal search path traced by LR $k$, $k \\in {1, 2}$.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here, $Z_1$ and $Z_2$ are the Decision Variables for the optimization problem.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that both $Z_1$ and $Z_2$ are different from the Z matrix we used as a decision variable in the previous problem since they are no longer symmetric. Also, we need an additional set of binary variables to track which feature is being measured by which LR.\n",
    "For this, we create a vector $S^{Nx1}$ such that:\n",
    "\n",
    "* $S_{i} = 1$ if LR-1 scans feature $i$.\n",
    "* $S_{i} = 0$ if LR-2 scans feature $i$.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that the choice of LR-1 and LR-2 is arbitrary. This variable is essential to this formulation since it changes the constraints that ensure that each feature is measured. Some rows can sum up to zero now since that feature may be measured by the other LR.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2.5.3 Optimization Algorithm - Constraints\n",
    "\n",
    "Since we go back to using a directed graph we go back to the class formulation and use *Indregree* and *Outdegree* constraints. For each node $X_i$ measured by LR-1 we impose constraints such that\n",

    "\n",
    "Finally, any time that we solve this problem and encounted a *Subtour* in our solution for LR-1 say, $\\{X_{1}, X_{2}, ..., X_{k}\\} = Sub$ such that {k < n}, we encode a constraint in our model to explicitly disallow *this particular subtour*. However, since the formulation is no longer symmetric, we also explicitly disallow the *reverse subtour* to potentially save ourself one iteration every time:\n",

    "\\end{equation*}\n",
    "\n",
    "If the subtour is in LR-2, we repeat the above constraint but replace the decision variable $Z_1$ with $Z_2$.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that this constraint is nowhere as efficient as the subtour elimination constraint from the symmetric formulation since it only excludes one particular subtour. In a vague sense, it is \"exponentially\" worse than the subtour elimination constraint in the previous case since we require to an exponential number of these constraints to eliminate the same number of subtours as the other case.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2.5.4 Optimization Algorithm - Objective\n",
    "\n",
    "We no longer optimize the same objective as the traditional TSP since we have two subtours happening simultaneously. We wish to minimize the maximum of the costs of the two subtours since the total time spent on measuring the features is simply equal to time spent on the larger tour. To do this, we use the epigraph trick. We minimize $t$ such that:\n",

    "Here $Z_{k_{i,j}} = 1$ when we have selected to use the path between sites $X_i$, $X_j$ in LR-k's tour and $C_{k_{i,j}}$ is the travel time of that path when measured by LR-k. The sum over all $Z_{k_{i,j}}C_{i,j}$ then is the total travel time for the path taken by LR-k. The total time taken to measure all $N$ features is the maximum of the two since both LRs work in parallel.\n",

We could potentially use this to evaluate the scan speed of a Lasar Radar from different \"candidate\" locations, and determine the optimal location to place the Lasar Radar as the one with the shortest scan time."

    "## 5. Conclusion ##\n",
    "\n",
    "* Solving this problem as a TSP definitely poses massive gains to the automotive engineer trying to improve the efficiency on an assembly line. With the symmetric formulation, the problem remains tractable even for a practical number of features (certainly 50+). We discuss the gains of this formulation in further detail in the [Appendix](#6.-Appendix)\n",
    "* The 2-LR problem has potential for even more significant improvement if we could model a symmetric formulation that eliminates full combinations of subtours with single constraints. At time of publishing, the ability to do this remains an open problem.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 5.1 Future Work \n",
    "\n",
    "* We are working to come up with a symmetric formulation of the 2-LR problem as the gains from adding another LR to the setup can be massive, especially if it is located \"optimally\".\n",
    "* We have assumed that the set of all features given to us are \"measurable\", however in practice we find that certain features have restrictions on which angles they can be measured from. For example, a stud cannot be measured unless the angle between the stud and the line of sight of the LR is more than 30 degrees, and 'hole' features can only be measured when the line-of-sight to hole-normal is less than 60 degrees. We can model this as a feasibility problem as a pre-processing step to the optimal ordering problem.\n",
    "* On the same lines as the previous problem, we can also try to find the optimal placement of the LR to minimize the scan time constrained to known measurement accuracy tradeoffs for a given set of features.\n",
    "* As we can see, all these problems are similar in that they seem intractable at first but with the right formulation, they can be solved for reasonable instances. Another aspect that is common to these problems is that they can cause significant improvement in efficiency of an assembly line in real life!\n",
    "\n",
    "### 5.2 Coolest Observations\n",
    "\n",
    "* The symmetric formulation drastically reduces the run-time of the optimal ordering problem! We find that the solution still remains exponential in time complexity but is several orders of magnitude faster than the regular formulation. We attribute these gains primarily to the subtour elimination constraint. In the symmetric formulation, each subtour elimination constraint eliminates an exponential number of subtours since it takes into account all possible subtours that can be formed with those combinations of nodes.\n",
    "* Section #4.2 proves our initial hypothesis that the location of the LR drastically changes the optimal solution despite giving a free pass to the first node. It is easy to miss that the \"distances\" between nodes depends implicitly on the position of the LR as the scan takes place in PCS. The initial step where we compute the cost matrices is critical in setting up our TSP. If we had naively used Euclidean distance as the cost metric between nodes, we would have missed the inherent motion equations of a measurement devices that works in a spherical coordinate system.\n",
    "* The formulation of the 2-LR problem proved to be challenging and yet rewarding. Since our objective was actually a minimum of a maximum, we were able to use the epigraph trick to make that feasible. The use of binary variables to keep track of which LR was measuring each feature was critical and fit in smoothly with all the other constraints. We can now see the original problem as a special case of the 2-LR problem where all $S_i$s are constrained to be 1."

    "\n",
    "Of course, our Symmetric Formulation with all-subtour elimination is by far the fastest. To see why, we can observe the right graph, which shows the number of constraints added for a given solution as the number of features considered grows. While the number of constraints for the first three formulations spikes up rapidly, the number of constraints for the Symmetric Subtour Elimination strategy increases at a sub-exponential rate - mostly due to Subtour Elimination Constraint described in [Section 2.4.3](#2.4.3-Optimization-Algorithm---Constraints). This constraint eliminates *all* possible subtours from a given set of nodes, not just one particular subtour; this is powerful enough to allow this formulation to stay at relatively low numbers of constraints even as the number of features grows. It also helps that we are using a symmetric matrix, so we don't have to eliminate a subtour and its reverse on every iteration. Without our Symmteric Formulation with Lazy Subtour Elimination, this problem would have been too computationally expensive to solve.\n",
    "\n",
    "It is important to note that the symmetric formulation is not a 'silver bullet' for the TSP problem. The timing comparison (left plot) still shows 4 algorithms having a linear trajectory on a log-scale axis, meaning that indeed all 4 algorithms are exponential in their growth. It just so happens that the symmetric formulation has a much lower growth constant than the others. "
