    "The [Nikon Laser Radar](https://www.nikonmetrology.com/en-us/product/laser-radar-mv331-351) is a high accuracy, large volume, non-contact, 3D measurement device that is gaining considerable adoption in the automotive industry for [in-line car body inspection](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odIYMRyCFDo). This inspection has traditionally been done with a tactile CMM which is a slow process requiring one-of-every-N cars to be spurred off the main assembly line into a carefully controlled 'measurement room'. Automotive manufacturers [can achieve considerable cost and time savings](http://www.nikonmetrology.com/en-gb/product/laser-radar-shop-floor-cmm) by switching to a robot-mounted laser-based measurement system such as the Laser Radar to inspect *all* part instances in-line, without special 1-of-N measurement followed by generalizing results to the remainder of the unmeasured instances. The laser-based measurement technology is mature, however, this relatively new adoption by the short cycle-time automotive industry has placed new pressure on maximizing the quantity and quality of feature measurements that can be made in short, fixed time windows common in assembly line manufacturing. By applying optimization techniques to the measurement plan and process, we can to increase both the quality and quantity of measurements that can be made in a fixed time window.\n",
    "\n",
    "Automotive engineers routinely specify geometric features that must be inspected on a car when it is in the [Body-In-White](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Body_in_white) phase of manufacturing. Inspection involves measuring the 3D locations and dimensions of 200-300 holes, slots, studs, surfaces, etc relative to fixed locations on the car. The measured location of these features are compared to the nominal locations specified in the CAD drawings. [Statistical process control](https://www.itl.nist.gov/div898/handbook/pmc/section1/pmc12.htm) calculations are performed to evaluate the overal accuracy, precision, reliability, and repeatability of the manufacturing process. The task of scanning each feature and extracting the location of the measured geometry relative to a global ‘car coordinate system’ is well handled by existing software.\n",
    "![Nikon Laser Radar](LR_Combo.jpg)\n",
    "\n",
    "However, the process of deciding *how* to measure these features using the Laser Radar is a decision largely made by manufacturing engineers using 'rule-of-thumb' techniques based on their experience with robot and tactile CMM programming. Often these engineers have little experience with laser based measurement systems. The opportunity to optimize this scenario lies in several sub-problems:\n",
    "\n",
    "* *Determine the optimal order in which to measure a list of features.* Pointing the measuring laser of the device to each feature location requires moving a mirror in azimuth and elevation, both of which have known velocity and acceleration profiles and limits. The optimization task is: For a given fixed laser radar location relative to the car, find an ordering of a given list of features to be measured that minimizes total measurement time.\n",
    "\n",
    "* *Determine the optimal location at which to locate the Laser Radar.* Each feature type that is measured (hole, slot, stud, etc) has certain line-of-sight geometry characteristics that affect the confidence in the accuracy of the final measurement. For example, stud features achieve best accuracy when the laser’s line of sight has a particular angle relative to the stud’s normal direction. Holes, on the other hand, are most accurate when the laser’s line of sight is closer to the normal direction of the hole. The optimization task is: Given the line-of-sight geometry characteristics for each type of feature geometry, find an optimal placement of the Laser Radar device such that the accuracy of measurement of all n features (of varying types) in a given list is maximized. \n",

    "### 2.1 Coordinate Systems\n",
    "Within the work cell, there are many coordinate systems being used. To keep the focus of this work on the optimization component, we will simplify the work cell to two fundamental coordinate systems: The Part Coordinate System (PCS), and Machine Coordinate System (MCS). It is important to understand each and be able to freely convert points in space between these coordinate systems.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Part coordinate system (PCS)**: This is a 3D Cartesian coordinate system that is the same coordinate system the engineer used in CAD to design the car. In our models, this coordinate system has its origin on the centerline of the car, both side-to-side and front-to-back, and is located underneath the car. The Z-axis is points toward the front of the car, and the Y-axis points upward. Being a right-handed coordinate system, this leaves the X-axis to points toward the driver's side door.  All features to be measured are defined in this coordinate system. Also, the location and orientation of the Laser Radar in the work cell is specified in this coordinate system.\n",
    "![Part Coordinate System](PCS.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Machine coordinate system (MCS)**: This is the coordinate system from the viewpoint of the Laser Radar. (The historical name 'Machine' comes from the world of CNC and tactile CMM devices). The Laser Radar measures in a [spherical coordinate system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spherical_coordinate_system): It measures *range* using reflected signal from an IR laser, and the laser itself can be 'steered' in *azimuth* and *elevation* by means of a motorized mirror that spins on one axis and pivots on an orthoganal axis. The *azimuth*, or $\\phi$, ranges from -180 to 180 degrees $(-\\pi, \\pi)$, with 0 being the front of the Laser Radar. The *elevation*, or $\\theta$, ranges from -45 to +45 degrees relative to horizontal. To stay with standard ISO spherical coordinate conventions, we will define this as $\\theta$, to be measured as the inclination angle, or the angle relative to vertical, giving it a valid range of $(\\frac{\\pi}{4}, \\frac{3\\pi}{4})$, with $\\frac{\\pi}{2}$ being horizontal. See diagram below (courtesy Wikipedia). The $\\phi$ and $\\theta$ angles of the mirror are recorded by two highly accurate encoders inside the Laser Radar, and when synchronized with the laser's range measurement, form a spherical coordinate triple $(r, \\theta, \\phi)$ that originates from the center of the mirror on the laser radar.\n",
    "![Spherical Coordinate System](SphericalCS.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "The first transformation required for optimzation is converting Spherical MCS to Cartesian MCS. This is accomplished using standard trigonometry:\n",
    "\\begin{align*}\n",
    "x &= r \\sin \\theta \\cos \\phi \\\\\n",
    "y &= r \\sin \\theta \\sin \\phi \\\\\n",
    "z &= r \\cos \\theta\n",
    "\\end{align*}\n",
    "And likewise, we can convert Cartesian MCS to Spherical MCS:\n",
    "\\begin{align*}\n",
    "r &= \\sqrt{x^2 + y^2 + z^2} \\\\\n",
    "\\theta &= \\arccos\\frac{z}{\\sqrt{x^2 + y^2 + z^2}} = \\arctan \\frac{\\sqrt{x^2+y^2}}{z}\\\\\n",
    "\\phi &= \\arctan \\frac{y}{x} \\\\\n",
    "\\end{align*}\n",
    "\n",
    "Note the manipulation of $\\theta$ by trig identities to reformulate using the $\\arctan$ function. For correct results in quadrants 2 and 4, it is necessary to use the function `atan2()` programmatically to account for sign changes.\n",
    "\n",
    "The second transformation required for optimization is converting Cartesian MCS to PCS. This is accomplished via a standard 3D affine transformation. We define the location and orientation of the Laser Radar within the part coordinate system according to a homogeneous transformation matrix. If the Laser Radar's orientation is described by its 3 orthogonal axis $X$, $Y$, and $Z$ as orthonormal vectors $U$, $V$, and $W$ in PCS, and the Laser Radar's mirror center is described in PCS as point $(LR_x, LR_y, LR_z)$, then the matrix that transforms a point in Cartesian MCS point to the same point in PCS is \n",
    "\\begin{equation*}\n",
    "T_{\\text{MCS to PCS}} = \\begin{bmatrix} \n",
    "U_x & V_x & W_x & LR_x \\\\\n",
    "U_y & V_y & W_y & LR_y \\\\\n",
    "U_z & V_z & W_z & LR_z \\\\\n",
    "0   & 0   & 0   & 1\n",
    "\\end{bmatrix}\n",
    "\\end{equation*}\n",
    "And, of course, the matrix that transforms PCS points to Cartesian MCS points is simply the inverse:\n",

    "### 2.2 Measurement Feature Definitions\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 2.2.1 Feature CSV Files\n",
    "\n",
    "In this problem, we are given a list of features on the Car Body that must be scanned by Nikon Laser Radar. Since these features are extracted directed from the CAD figures of the Car Body, they are given to us in the Cartesian PCS coordinate system. For a given features $X_i$, we are given\n",
    "\n",
    "* The Feature Type - This is what the laser is measuring. This can be Hole, Slot, Stud, Rectangle, Surface Vector, or Sphere.\n",
    "* $(X, Y, Z)$ - The cartesian coordinates of the feature in the PCS coordinate system.\n",
    "* $(I, J, K)$ - The normal vector of the feature in PCS.\n",
    "\n",
    "An example of one of the feature csv files that we use in this problem is *50_Holes_FrontLeft.csv*.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 2.2.2 Lasar Radar Location CSV Files\n",
    "\n",
    "We are also given different potential locations and orientations for the Lasar Radar, from which it will scan the car. These are in the files *Location1.csv*, *LocationLeft.csv*, and *LocationRight.csv*. Each one of these files contains a 4x4 matrix in the format of a $T_{\\text{MCS to PCS}}$ matrix seen above that encode the location and orientation of the Lasar Radar. As shown below, we can use this to transform the $(X, Y, Z)$ feature coordinates in the PCS coordinate system to cartesian coordinates in the MCS coordinate system.\n",
    "\n",
    "Notably, when solving the shortest path problem for different locations of the Lasar Radar, we get different solutions. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2.3 Laser Radar Motion\n",
    "\n",
    "For the purposes of this project, we assume that the Nikon Laser Radar remains stationary and can rotates the laser in azimuth and elevation to create a scanning path through all of the required features of the car body. We relax the problem here by ignoring acceleration of the motorized mirror, as we believe this to be negligible. However, the Lasar Radar is capable of rotating in azimuth and elevation simultaneously, which we must incorporate into our model. To do so, we first map each feature $X_i$ into Spherical Coordinates relative to the MCS as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "$X_{\\text{i, MCS Cartesian}} = T_{\\text{PCS to MCS}} * X_{\\text{i, PCS Cartesian}}$\n",
    "\n",
    "From here, we can find the Spherical Coordinates $(r_{\\text{i, MCS}}, \\theta_{\\text{i, MCS}}, \\phi_{\\text{i, MCS}})$ using the triganometric equations described above.\n",
    "\n",
    "From this, we can convert our list of features $\\{X_i\\}_{i=1}^{\\text{Number Features}}$ into spherical coordinates.\n",
    "\n",
    "For any two features, $X_i, X_j$, we can calculate the time for the Lasar Radar to travel between them as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Assume that the Lasar Radar starts at either point $X_i$ or $X_j$, it immediately begins rotating in both azimuth *and* elevation to the other point.\n",
    "* We assume that the Lasar Radar rotates in azimuth with speed $v_{\\text{azimuth}}$ radians per second, and rotates in elevation with speed $v_{\\text{elevation}}$ radians per second.\n",
    "* The time that it will take to rotate in azimuth is\n",
    "\n",
    "\\begin{equation*}\n",
    "\\frac{|\\phi_i - \\phi_j|}{v_{\\text{elevation}}}\n",
    "\\end{equation*}\n",
    "\n",
    "* Similarly, the time that it takes to rotate in elevation is\n",
    "\n",
    "\\begin{equation*}\n",
    "\\frac{|\\theta_i - \\theta_j|}{v_{\\text{azimuth}}}\n",
    "\\end{equation*}\n",
    "\n",
    "* Since the Lasar Radar moves in both of these directions simultaneously, the time it takes to travel from features $X_i$ to feature $X_j$ is the maximum of these two quantities, or the *Inifnity Norm* of the vector of travel times of each direction in spherical coordinates. Specifically, this is:\n",
    "\n",
    "\\begin{equation*}\n",
    "t_{i,j} = \\big\\Vert\\frac{\\theta_i - \\theta_j}{v_{\\text{elevation}}}, \\frac{\\phi_i - \\phi_j}{v_{\\text{azimuth}}}\\big\\Vert_{\\infty}\n",
    "\\end{equation*}\n",
    "\n",
    "For the scope of this project, we simply set $v_{\\text{elevation}} = v_{\\text{azimuth}} = 1\\frac{radian}{second}$. However, this formulation is flexible enough that it would allow an Automotive Engineer to substitute in the speeds for their own Laser Radars, and calculate a correct solution.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2.4 Optimal Measurement Plan Path\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2.4.1 Formulating as TSP problem\n",
    "\n",
    "**Inputs:** \n",
    "* _LR Location/orientation matrix_: The location of the laser radar with respet to the features to be measured is critical in determining the cost matrix because the nodes to visit are defined in spherical coordinates relative to the mirror of the laser radar.\n",
    "* _Mirror Azimuth and Elevation velocities_: These velocities determine how fast the laser radar can move its measurement laser from one location to another. For this model, we assume instantaneous acceleration to start and stop the mirror, and constant velocity during travel. This is reasonable for this model because the mirror assembly has relatively low mass and low moment of inertia, so accelerations are fast.\n",
    "* _Unordered site location list:_ (csv file containing points to visit) This defines the location of the features to be measured in spherical coordinates with respect to the Laser Radar's mirror. The feature definition file described above contains feature locations in cartesian coordinates relative to the car's coordinate system. Before constructing the cost matrix, these cartesian coordinates must be converted to spherical coordinates relative to he Laser Radar's coordinate system. This transformation is described above.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Output:**\n",
    "* _Optimal Ordered Site Visiting List_: This is the optimal ordering of sites produced by the solved TSP; this makes up the optimal path for the Lasar Radar to follow to minimize the total time for a single scan.\n",
    "* _Minimal Scan Time_: This is the amount of time that it will take to scan all of the features, using the given optimal path.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Cost Matrix:**\n",
    "* _Travel Time Matrix_: As seen above, we can compute the distance between two features $X_i$, $X_j$ by first converting their PCS coordinates into MCS coordinates; then, converting these into MCS spherical coordinates, and then finally taking the infinity norm over the azimuth travel time and elevation travel time for the two features. By iterating over all pairs of features $X_i$, $X_j$ in our dataset, we can construct a cost matrix $C^{NxN}$ such that $C_{i,j}$ is the travel time between features $X_i$ and $X_j$; this is simply $t_{i,j}$ as calculated above. By precomputing this cost matrix, we can solve the computational geometry portion of this problem entirely in the preprocessing step, leaving the remainder of this problem to be solved as a standard Travelling Salesman Problem (TSP).\n",
    "\n",
    "**Optimization Algorithm**:\n",
    "\n",
    "Once the inputs are properly defined, and a cost matrix is constructed, TSP algorithm can be applied. In our implementation, we implemented four different TSP algorithms:\n",
    "1. MTZ formulation (from class lecture)\n",
    "2. Iterative Subtour Elimination (from class lecture)\n",
    "3. Subtour Elmination using Lazy Constraints (based on 2, but using additional JuMP/Gurobi capability of `@lazyconstraint`)\n",
    "4. Symmetric Matrix & Lazy Subtour Elimination (based on Gurobi website [example](http://examples.gurobi.com/traveling-salesman-problem/))\n",
    "\n",
    "We evaluated the performance of each, and settled on \\#4 - the Symmetrix Matrix with Lazy Subtour Elimination algorithm. Therefore, only this algorithm will be discussed here, but a thorough comparison of all four can be seen in the [Appendix](#6.-Appendix). The high-level results of this evaluation are also discussed in [Section 4](#4.-Results-and-discussion).\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2.4.2 Optimization Algorithm - Decision Variables\n",
    "\n",
    "Given our set of $N$ site locations $\\{X_i\\}_{i=1}^{N}$ for the Lasar Radar to scan, we wish to construct the Optimal Scanning Path between them. We can first generate the Cost Matrix $C^{NxN}$ that encodes the travel time between each of the N features. Effectively, this is now reducible to the TSP Problem, as we wish to find the minimal travel time for a path connecting our N features. In a similar manner to other TSP formulations, we encode the selected path in a Symmetric Binary Matrix $Z^{NxN}$, such that\n",
    "\n",
    "* $Z_{i,j} = Z_{j,i} = 1$ if there is an edge between $X_i$, $X_j$ in the optimal search path.\n",
    "* $Z_{i,J} = Z_{j,i} = 0$ if there is no edge between $X_i$, $X_j$ in the optimal search path.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here, Z is the Decision Variable for the optimization problem.\n",
    "\n",
    "Something notable in our formulation is that $Z_{i,j} = Z_{j,i}, \\forall i,j \\in {1, ..., N}$. Effectively, this means that we are creating an undirected graph instead of a directed one. Then from this solution we can extract one of two optimal paths, which simply are the reverse of eachother.\n",
    "\n",
    "For this problem particularly, we decided that this was a reasonable assumption because our Cost Matrix C is symmetric itself, so both optimal solutions (forwards and backwards) will take the same time to scan. Therefore we can pick one of these two paths arbitrarily and still recover an optimal path to minimize scan time.\n",
    "\n",
    "One of the benefits of using an undirected graph formulation is that in the subtour elimination part of the solution, we only have to remove a given subtour once. In practice, we found that without this simplification we would often see that same subtours appearing twice, with the second one being a reverse ordering of this first. By using this formulation of the problem we effectively cut the number of iterations that we must do to find an optimal solution without subtours down by half.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2.4.3 Optimization Algorithm - Constraints\n",
    "\n",
    "The choice to use an undirected graph also changes how we represent our *Indregree* and *Outdegree* constraints. In previous formulations for the TSP Problem we explicit constraints on each node $X_i$ such that\n",
    "\n",
    "\\begin{equation*}\n",

    "\n",
    "\\begin{equation*}\n",
    "Outdegree(X_i) = 1, \\forall i \\in \\{1,...,N\\}\n",
    "\\end{equation*}\n",
    "\n",
    "Since we use an undirected graph, we simply need to state the the *Degree* of each node $X_i$ is 2; we can encode with the following constraint:\n",
    "\n",
    "\\begin{equation*}\n",
    "\\sum_{j=1}^{N} Z_{i,j} = 2, \\forall i \\in \\{1,...,N\\}\n",
    "\\end{equation*}\n",
    "\n",
    "We also retain the constraint can have no path to itself:\n",
    "\n",
    "\\begin{equation*}\n",
    "Z_{i,i} = 0, \\forall i \\in \\{1,...,N\\}\n",
    "\\end{equation*}\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, any time that we solve this problem and encounted a *Subtour* in our solution, $\\{X_{S1}, X_{S2}, ..., X_{Sk}\\}$ such that {k < n}, we encode a constraint in our model to explicitly disallow *this particular subtour*:\n",
    "\n",

    "\\sum_{i = 1}^{k} \\sum_{j = 1}^{k} Z_{Si, Sj} \\leq k -1\n",
    "\\end{equation*}\n",
    "\n",
    "Notably, this constraint not only disallows *this particular subtour*, but also *all possible subtours that can be formed out of these k nodes*. This is different than the standard Subtour Elimination Constraint that was discussed in lecture, but we found that this formulation for the Subtour Elimination Constraint dramatically reduced the computational time needed to solve the problem. Further discussion on the differences in efficiency between different problem formulations can be found in [Section 4](#4.-Results-and-discussion) and in the [Appendix](#6.-Appendix).\n",

    "Because we are only interested in quickly measuring each feature (visiting each site), we have no interest in returning to the first site at the conclusion of the measurement.

Therefore, we desire a 'path' rather than a 'tour'.\n",

    "2. Append a row and column to the cost matrix so that the cost to travel from any real point to the 'dummy point' is 0. \n",
    "3. This, node with zero cost everywhere gives a 'free pass' for the laser to move from any one single feature to any one single other feature with zero cost (by traveling through the 'dummy point').

    "4. Solve as usual, and produce the best order to visit the points.\n",

    "Of course, our Symmetric Formulation with all-subtour elimination is by far the fastest. To see why, we can observe the right graph, which shows the number of constraints added for a given solution as the number of features considered grows. While the number of constraints for the first three formulations spikes up rapidly, the number of constraints for the Symmetric Subtour Elimination strategy stays relatively constant - mostly due to Subtour Elimination Constraint described in [Section 2.4.3](#2.4.3-Optimization-Algorithm---Constraints). This constraint eliminates all possible subtours from a given set of nodes, not just one particular subtour; this is powerful enough to allow this formulation to stay at relatively low numbers of constraints even as the number of features grows. It also helps that we are using a symmetric matrix, so we don't have to eliminate a subtour and its reverse on every iteration. Without our Symmteric Formulation with Lazy Subtour Elimination, this problem would have been too computationally expensive to solve."
