    "Some notes on posing a satifiability problem to find a suitable location for a LR given a list of features:\n",
    "\n",
    "It might be interesting to pose it as:\n",
    "\n",
    "Given a list of features, find a location for the LR such that:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Objective: Maximize the number of targets that can be measured (sum of integer variables, one for each feature)\n",
    "* Subject to #1: Distance from LR to Feature is between n and m meters (say, n=2, m=6)\n",
    "* Subject to #2: Angle between line of sight and normal of feature is between 0 and m degrees (say, m=60)\n",
    "\n",
    "Start with the following restrictions:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Only allow the LR to move in X and Y (fix Z, Rx,Ry,Rz == 0)\n",
    "* Could even relax the first 'subject to' to be \"LR can be located max 6 meters from 0,0,0 of Car Coordinate system\"\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "And, if the above is taken to it's logical conclusion, I could see this easily morphing into is:\n",
    "\n",
    "Given features all around the car, the above could be the inner loop of a 'greedy' approach to finding a set of LR locations to measure all features on the car. For example, given a list of all features on the car\n",
    "1. Find the location where the maximum number of features can be measured.\n",
    "2. Repeat with the remaining features\n",
    "3. continue...\n",
    "\n",
    "In a sense, that extension is kind of lame, because greedy is not 'optimal', but it would work for 'a feasible solution'"
